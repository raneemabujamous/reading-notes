## HTTP Status Codes
REST APIs use the Status-Line part of an HTTP response message to inform clients of their request’s overarching result. RFC 2616 defines the Status-Line syntax as shown below:

Status-Line = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF

HTTP defines these standard status codes that can be used to convey the results of a client’s request. The status codes are divided into the five categories.

* 1xx: Informational – Communicates transfer protocol-level information.
* 2xx: Success – Indicates that the client’s request was accepted successfully.
* 3xx: Redirection – Indicates that the client must take some additional action in order to complete their request.
* 4xx: Client Error – This category of error status codes points the finger at clients.
* 5xx: Server Error – The server takes responsibility for these error status codes.


## Successful responses
* 200 OK
The request has succeeded. The meaning of the success depends on the HTTP method:

* GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.
HEAD: The representation headers are included in the response without any message body.
PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.
201 Created
The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result. This is typically the response sent after POST requests, or some PUT requests.

* 202 Accepted
The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is noncommittal, since there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.

* 203 Non-Authoritative Information
This response code means the returned meta-information is not exactly the same as is available from the origin server, but is collected from a local or a third-party copy. This is mostly used for mirrors or backups of another resource. Except for that specific case, the "200 OK" response is preferred to this status.

* 204 No Content
There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful. The user-agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones.

* 205 Reset Content
Tells the user-agent to reset the document which sent this request.

* 206 Partial Content
This response code is used when the Range header is sent from the client to request only part of a resource.

* 207 Multi-Status (WebDAV)
Conveys information about multiple resources, for situations where multiple status codes might be appropriate.

* 208 Already Reported (WebDAV)
Used inside a <dav:propstat> response element to avoid repeatedly enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection.

 * 226 IM Used (HTTP Delta encoding)
The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.
