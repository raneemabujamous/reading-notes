## Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

1-FilterableProductTable (orange): contains the entirety of the example
2-SearchBar (blue): receives all user input
3-ProductTable (green): displays and filters the data collection based on user input
4-ProductCategoryRow (turquoise): displays a heading for each category
5-ProductRow (red): displays a row for each product
  
  
  you look at ProductTable, you’ll see that the table header (containing the “Name” and “Price” labels) isn’t its own component. This is a matter of preference, and there’s an argument to be made either way. For this example, we left it as part of ProductTable because it is part of rendering the data collection which is ProductTable’s responsibility. However, if this header grows to be complex (e.g., if we were to add affordances for sorting), it would certainly make sense to make this its own ProductTableHeader component.

Now that we’ve identified the components in our mock, let’s arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mock should appear as a child in the hierarchy:

* FilterableProductTable

* SearchBar
* ProductTable

* ProductCategoryRow
* ProductRow
## Step 2: Build A Static Version in React
## Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State 
 ## Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live
 ## Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow
