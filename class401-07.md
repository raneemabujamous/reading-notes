## 1 Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)

In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.

Use the Singleton pattern when a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients; for example, a single database object shared by different parts of the program. The Singleton pattern disables all other means of creating objects of a class except for the special creation method.

## 2 Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes

Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
"The singleton pattern is used in programming languages such as Java and .NET to define a global variable. A single object used across systems remains constant and needs to be defined only once rather than many times".
"After we instantiate once, every time we call to instantiate again, it will not create another instance.. instead it will refer to only one instantiation (the first one)".

## 3-If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?

### Router Middleware

"The app.get() function is Application-level Middleware. the parameters passed to the method are req, res, and next. These are the incoming request, the response being written, and a method to call to pass the call to the next middleware function once the current middleware is finished. In this case, once the response is sent, the function exits. You could also chain other middleware here by calling the next() method.
Middlewares are features added on top of his basic handler, in the form of a stack of functions that take this request into a pipeline doing stuff with it (logging, parsing body, security ...ect).
Router is one of those middleware, what it does actualy is to take the original request, and forward it to a sub handler according to the path example : "/home" for a GET request is mapped to function getHome that handle it and eventually send a response to the client on the behalf of the original handler.

### Dynamic loading

Dynamic loading is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory.

### Singleton Pattern

the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.

### CRUD -> REST Method Matches

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are four primitive database operations. At first glance, these operations map well to the HTTP verbs most frequently used in REST: Create (SQL INSERT) : POST - Used to support the creation of a child resource, but can also modify the underlying state of a system.

### Mock Testing

Mocking is a process used in unit testing when the unit being tested has external dependencies. The purpose of mocking is to isolate and focus on the code being tested and not on the behavior or state of external dependencies.

## Securing Passwords with Bcrypt Hashing Function :

"Passwords are the first line of defense against cyber criminals. It is the most vital secret of every activity we do over the internet and also a final check to get into any of your user account, whether it is your bank account, email account, shopping cart account or any other account you have".

## Basic access authentication :

basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of Authorization: Basic , where credentials is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon .

## OWASP auth cheatsheet :

"Authentication is the process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be. Authentication in the context of web applications is commonly performed by submitting a username or ID and one or more items of private information that only a given user should know".
"Session Management is a process by which a server maintains the state of an entity interacting with it. This is required for a server to remember how to react to subsequent requests throughout a transaction".
