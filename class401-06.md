## Linked Lists

- linked list is a collection of nodes, starting with head object that will be null when the linked list is empty, then when adding the first node will update the value of the head to this node object, including the next propert that will point to the reference of the next node if it exist or null if it was the last node in the linked list.

- if we add a node to the first BigO of time will be O(1), but if we add between nodes or at the end, BigO of time will be O(n). and in the both cases the BigO of space will be as the value of nodes, and mostly will be O(1).

- there are two types of linked lists : singly & doubly; the difference is the singly only have one pointer to the next node. but the doubly has two pointers; the first one for the next node and the second one for the previous node.

## What took place

1. We first create Current at the Head to guarantee we are starting from the beginning.
2. We create the while loop and this will only run is the node that Current is pointing too is not null.
3. Once we are in the while loop, we are checking if the value of the current node is equal to the value that we were looking for.
4. If the Current node does not contain the value we are looking for, we must move the current to the next node that is being referenced.
   5.At this point, the while loop is run again and steps 3 & 4 will continue until Current reaches the end of the LinkedList.

## Whatâ€™s a Linked List, pt2

Big O Notation is a way of evaluating the performance of an algorithm.
Big O determine how much the time & space we need to run this algorithm.
O(1) : means i need a constant time & and same space, and doesn't matter how much the elements we have or how huge our input is.
O(n) : means that as our input grows, the space and time that we need to run that algorithm grows linearly.
a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.
