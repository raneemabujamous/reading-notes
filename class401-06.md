## Linked Lists

- linked list is a collection of nodes, starting with head object that will be null when the linked list is empty, then when adding the first node will update the value of the head to this node object, including the next propert that will point to the reference of the next node if it exist or null if it was the last node in the linked list.

- if we add a node to the first BigO of time will be O(1), but if we add between nodes or at the end, BigO of time will be O(n). and in the both cases the BigO of space will be as the value of nodes, and mostly will be O(1).

- there are two types of linked lists : singly & doubly; the difference is the singly only have one pointer to the next node. but the doubly has two pointers; the first one for the next node and the second one for the previous node.

## What took place

1. We first create Current at the Head to guarantee we are starting from the beginning.
2. We create the while loop and this will only run is the node that Current is pointing too is not null.
3. Once we are in the while loop, we are checking if the value of the current node is equal to the value that we were looking for.
4. If the Current node does not contain the value we are looking for, we must move the current to the next node that is being referenced.
   5.At this point, the while loop is run again and steps 3 & 4 will continue until Current reaches the end of the LinkedList.

## What’s a Linked List, pt2

Big O Notation is a way of evaluating the performance of an algorithm.
Big O determine how much the time & space we need to run this algorithm.
O(1) : means i need a constant time & and same space, and doesn't matter how much the elements we have or how huge our input is.
O(n) : means that as our input grows, the space and time that we need to run that algorithm grows linearly.
a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.

### SQL vs NoSQL: High-Level Differences

- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
- SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.
  SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
- SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
- SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.
- SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
  For complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL don’t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.

## The diagram above shows my method to model a relational database table. The major elements that are depicted include:

- The Table Name, which is located at the top of the table.
- The Primary Keys. Remember the primary keys uniquely identify each row in a table. A table typically has one primary key, but can have more. When the key has more than one column, it is called a compound key.
- Table Columns – There can be one or more table columns. To keep the diagrams simple, I don’t show the data types. I may introduce those later when we focus on more comprehensive modeling.
- Foreign Key – This is a column or set of columns which match a primary key in another table.
