## The key characteristics of ‘enhanced teams’
After years of analyzing data and interviews from more than 180 teams across the company, Google found that the kinds of people (a.k.a. the individual personalities) in a team are not so relevant.

“We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter,” Dubey said in an interview with The New York Times.

** Instead, the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams: **

* Psychological safety: Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.
* Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time.
Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.
* Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).
* Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.
Not all researchers agree
 While Google’s findings may be true to some extent, a large number of scientific studies have caused researchers (outside of Google’s lab) to shockingly disagree. They claim the exact opposite — that personality, not just skills, is indeed a significant factor in what makes a team successful.

Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a professor of business psychology at Columbia University and author of the book “Why Do So Many Incompetent Men Become Leaders? (and How to Fix It),” and psychologist Dave Winsborough, former VP at Hogan Assessment Systems, argue personality, in particular, heavily affects the role of an individual within a team.

`Too often, organizations focus merely on the functional role and hope that good team performance somehow follows,”` Chamorro-Premuzic and Winsborough co-wrote in a Harvard Business Review article. `This is why even the most expensive professional sports teams often fail to perform according to the individual talents of each player: There is no psychological synergy. A more effective approach focuses as much on people’s personalities as on their skills.”`

One study, conducted at Hogan X, adds an alternative lens to Google’s findings. Researchers found that individuals within poor-performing teams are generally 100 percent “`pragmatic`” and have 0 percent “`relationship-building`” traits.
