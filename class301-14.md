## Auth0 React SDK for Single Page Apps
** The Auth0 React SDK (auth0-react.js) is a JavaScript library for implementing authentication and authorization in React apps with Auth0. It provides a custom React hook and other Higher Order Components so you can secure React apps using best practices while writing less code. **

The Auth0 React SDK handles grant and protocol details, token expiration and renewal, as well as token storage and caching. Under the hood, it implements Universal Login and the Authorization Code Grant Flow with PKCE.

The library is hosted on GitHub where you can read more about the API.
