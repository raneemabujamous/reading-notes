### Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes

### Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree

### K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.

### Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree

### Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree

### Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node

### Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children

### Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

### There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

- Depth First
- Breadth First

##### Pre-order means that the root has to be looked at first. In our case, looking at the root just means that we output its value. When we call preOrder for the first time, the root will be added to the call stack:

### Depth first

traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root. Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

### Breadth First

Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. So, given our starting tree one more time:

## Big O

The Big O time complexity of a Binary Search Tree’s insertion and search operations is O(h), or O(height). In the worst case, we will have to search all the way down to a leaf, which will require searching through as many nodes as the tree is tall. In a balanced (or “perfect”) tree, the height of the tree is log(n). In an unbalanced tree, the worst case height of the tree is n.

The Big O space complexity of a BST search would be O(1). During a search, we are not allocating any additional space.
