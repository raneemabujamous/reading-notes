### Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()
useReducer() is a method from the React Hooks API, similar to useState but gives you more control to manage the state. It takes a reducer function and initial state as arguments and returns the state and dispatch method:
A reducer (being called that because of the function type you would pass to an array methodArray.prototype.reduce(reducer, initialValue)) is a pattern taken from the Redux. If you are not familiar with Redux, in short, a reducer is a pure function that takes previous state and action as an argument, and returns the next state.
