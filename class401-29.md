### How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?

The second array argument allows you to specify which prop variables trigger the useEffect() callback (if any) when their value(s) change. By passing an empty array, this means that useEffect() won't be triggered by any changes to input prop variables and will in turn only ever be called once, during the first render.

### Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?

To update the component's state invoke the updater function setState(newState) with the new state. The component re-renders and state receives the new value newState.,Invoking the state updater function setState(newState) with the new value updates the state.

### Is useState() synchronous?

useState and setState both are asynchronous. They do not update the state immediately but have queues that are used to update the state object. This is done to improve the performance of the rendering of React components. ... The state update usually happens on the next render, but even that can vary.

### State Hook

useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.

### Component Lifecycle

Components are created (mounted on the DOM), grow by updating, and then die (unmount on DOM). This is referred to as a component lifecycle. There are different lifecycle methods that React provides at different phases of a component's life. ... At present, we know what lifecycle methods are and why they are important.

### useReducer

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);

useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.

### How does useReducer work?

useReducer is used to store and update states, just like the useState Hook. It accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second.

useReducer returns an array that holds the current state value and a dispatch function, to which you can pass an action and later invoke. This is similar to the pattern Redux uses but with a few differences.

For example, the useReducer function is tightly coupled to a specific reducer. We dispatch action objects to that reducer only, whereas in Redux, the dispatch function sends the action object to the store. At the time of dispatch, the components don’t need to know the reducer that will process the action.

For those who may be unfamiliar with Redux, we’ll explore this concept a bit further. There are three main building blocks in Redux:

- A store — an immutable object that holds the applications state data

- A reducer — a function that returns some state data, triggered by an action type

- An action — an object that tells the reducer how to change the state. It must contain a type property, and it can contain an optional payload property
