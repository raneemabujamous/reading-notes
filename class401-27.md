### How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?

Plain JS apps usually start with the initial UI created on the server (as HTML), whereas React apps start with a blank HTML page, and dynamically create the initial state in JavaScript. React requires you to break your UI into components, but plain JS apps can be structured in any way you see fit.
What makes React such a desirable library to learn is that it doesn't replace HTML. It takes advantage of HTML's popularity and strength as the most popular programming language, by letting you use a very similar syntax to HTML to build interfaces and add dynamic features to it using JavaScript.
Event handling in HTML and React are different from one another in terms of syntax and some rules. The reason behind this is that React works on the concept of virtual DOM, on the other hand, the HTML has access to the Real DOM all the time.

### What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?

A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element. There is no render method used in functional components.
First of all, the clear difference is the syntax. Just like in their names, a functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that returns JSX. A class component is a JavaScript class that extends React. Component which has a render method.

Class components are used as container components to handle state management and wrap child components. Functional components generally are just used for display purposes - these components call functions from parent components to handle user interactions or state updates.

### Children / Child Components

children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component. A simple example: Here's an example of a stateless function that is used to create a component.
