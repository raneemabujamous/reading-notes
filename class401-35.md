## Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of `vertices` (or `nodes`) potentially connected by line segments named `edges`.

## common used when working with Graphs:

### Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

### Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

### Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

### Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

### Directed vs Undirected

An `Undirected` Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
A `Directed` Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

### Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

There are many different types of graphs. This depends on how connected the graphs are to other node/vertices.

The three different types are completed, connected, and disconnected.

### Acyclic vs Cyclic

In addition to undirected and directed graphs, we also have acyclic and cyclic graphs.

## Acyclic Graph

An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

Here is an example of 3 acyclic graphs:

### Traversals

You will be required to traverse through a graph. The traversals itself are like those of trees. Below is a breakdown of how you would traverse a graph.

### Breadth First

In a breadth first traversal, you are starting at a specific vertex/node. This node must be specified when calling the BreadthFirst() method. The breadth-first traversal of a graph is like that of a tree, with the exception that graphs can have cycles. Traversing a graph that has cycles will result in an infinite loop….this is bad. To prevent such behavior, we need to have some way to keep track of whether a vertex has been “visited” before. Upon each visit, we’ll add the previously-unvisited vertex to a visited set, so we know not to visit it again as traversal continues.

As a refresher of what breadth first actually means here it is: Breadth first traversal is when you visit all the nodes that are closest to the root as possible. From there you traverse outwards, level by level, until you have visited all the vertices/nodes.

Here is what the algorithm breadth first traversal looks like:

- Enqueue the declared start node into the Queue.
- Create a loop that will run while the node still has nodes present.
- Dequeue the first node from the queue
  if the Dequeue‘d node has unvisited child nodes, add the unvisited children to visited set and insert them into the queue.
