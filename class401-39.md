## What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?

React Redux re-evaluates selectors multiple times

To say that another way: each time an action is dispatched, every selector in the app must be re-evaluated. When we're dispatching multiple actions in a row, this can get quite expensive.

## When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?

To dispatch async actions into our store, we have to apply the thunk middleware by writing: const store = createStore(joke, applyMiddleware(thunk)); to apply the middleware. Then in App , we call dispatch with the function returned from the fetchJoke passed inside.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

### middleware

Middleware is a type of computer software that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system. ... Middleware makes it easier for software developers to implement communication and input/output, so they can focus on the specific purpose of their application.

### thunk

Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object. That function receives the store's dispatch method, which is then used to dispatch regular synchronous actions inside the function's body once the asynchronous operations have been completed.
