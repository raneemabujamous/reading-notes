### Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server

They are both ways you can implement an API. Within an Express Server you define your routes and write the logic for them. With AWS API Gateway, you set up your routes and then implement the functionality using lamda functions.

### List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each

Amazon Aurora.
Amazon DynamoDB.
Amazon ElastiCache.
Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)
Amazon Neptune.
Amazon Relational Database Service.
Amazon RDS on VMware.
Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB)

AWS RDS is a relational database service. You would use it in the same situations where you would use a MySql, Postgres or MS SQL Server — where you need to work with relational data.

DynamoDB is a NoSql database service. You would use it in the same situations as you would use products like MongoDB and other NoSql systems — processing documents, atomic records, jagged-edge structures, etc.

If you need very defined structure to your data storage you may want to consider something like AWS RDS, MySQL, or Postgres. If not, NoSQL systems like AWS DynamoDB, and MongoDB are generally faster to develop on as they forego much of these structure requirements.

### What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once. FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it.

### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

Logging and using timestamps and checking whether it was delivered based on the response sent from the endpoint.

### Serverless API

Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider

### Triggers

Essentially a connection between resources. When something happens to a resource, it triggers an action to be taken.

### Dynamo vs Mongo

MongoDB is one of the most famous documents oriented database whereas DynamoDB is scalable, hosted NoSQL database service provided by Amazon with the facility to store the data in Amazon's cloud. ... Mongo database offers some API for user-defined Map/Reduce methods, whereas Map Reduce is not supported in Dynamo database.
Dynamo is like the AWS version of Mongo. Mongo is open source and uses JSON objects, whereas Dynamo uses tables. MongoDB is less restrictive of data types and size.

### Dynamoose vs Mongoose

Dynamoose is a modeling tool used for dynamo and mongoose is used for mongo.

### Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

SNS

### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

SNS

### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

SNS

### Service Description

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product see the Amazon SNS product page. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.

### For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see Identity and access management in Amazon SNS in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.

### We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to Tools for Amazon Web Services.
