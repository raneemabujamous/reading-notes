### What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

Data packets are able to find the destination without the use of a dedicated channel. Reduces lost data packets because packet switching allows for resending of packets. More cost-effective since there is no need for a dedicated channel for voice or data traffic.

### UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?

UDP is a connectionless protocol. No connection needs to be established between the source and destination before you transmit data. UDP does not have a mechanism to make sure that the payload is not corrupted. As a result, the application must take care of data integrity all by itself.

### Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?

Yes, a socker server application can have many socket connections, Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to

### Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

Yes, a socket connection application can be connected to multiple socket servers.Thus the server can have many TCP sockets using the same local port, as long as each of the sockets on the port is connected to a different remote location. Theoretically, yes. Practice, not.

### Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

Yes, a socket connection application can be connected to multiple socket servers.Thus the server can have many TCP sockets using the same local port, as long as each of the sockets on the port is connected to a different remote location. Theoretically, yes. Practice, not.

### The Observer pattern

The Observer pattern offers a subscription model in which objects subscribe to an event and get notified when the event occurs. This pattern is the cornerstone of event driven programming, including JavaScript. The Observer pattern facilitates good object-oriented design and promotes loose coupling.

### listener

An event listener is a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur. The simple example of an event is a user clicking the mouse or pressing a key on the keyboard.

### Event Handler :

a function that runs when a specific event occurs.

### Event Driven Programming :

Event driven" is a programming paradigm that consists of user actions/interactions that trigger the next flow of events. Modern dynamic apps are built to respond to events, user clicks, voice commands, and other interactions in an asynchronous programming model.

### Event Loop :

design pattern that executes and reacts to events by monitorying the call stack and callback queue

### Event Queue :

A queue containing the operations that should be sent for execution , is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system.

### Call Stack :

The call stack contains the order that an interpreter needs to perform called functions .

### Emit/Raise/Trigger :

used to trigger an event , in event-driven programming, emit sends a message to trigger a response and raise an event .

### Subscribe

:subscribe dom events in browser or node.js events ,to listen to or keep track of a certain event .

### database :

An organized collection used to systematically store persistant data .

### Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

sockets

### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

sockets

### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

client side in socket

### WebSocket

is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C.

### What Socket.IO is#

Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It consists of:

## IO#

Exposed as the io namespace in the standalone build, or the result of calling require("socket.io-client").
