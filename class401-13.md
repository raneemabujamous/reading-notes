### Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

Yes, a socket connection application can be connected to multiple socket servers.Thus the server can have many TCP sockets using the same local port, as long as each of the sockets on the port is connected to a different remote location. Theoretically, yes. Practice, not.

### Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

Yes, a socket connection application can be connected to multiple socket servers.Thus the server can have many TCP sockets using the same local port, as long as each of the sockets on the port is connected to a different remote location. Theoretically, yes. Practice, not.
