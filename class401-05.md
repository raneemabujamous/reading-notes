## What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice enabling developers to create proper specifications about how their code should be written and implemented. Fundamentally, TDD is a practice when a programmer writes a functional test before building a code.

## 1-Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

1. Better program design and higher code quality

2. Detailed project documentation

3. TDD reduces the time required for project development

**The difference is beforeEach()/afterEach() automatically run before and after each tests, which 1. removes the explicit calls from the tests themselves, and 2. invites inexperienced users to share state between tests.**

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

If you have some work you need to do repeatedly for many tests
beforeEach() can be used before an event takes place so we could initialize a database.
Followed by afterEach() which could clear out the results in a database.

## What is one downside of Test Driven Development

1-The test suite itself has to be maintained; tests may not be completely deterministic (i.e. reliant on external dependencies).
2-The tests may be hard to write, esp. beyond the unit testing level.
3-Initially, it slows down development; for rapidly iterative startup environments the implementation code may not be ready for some time due to spending time writing tests first. (But in the long run, it actually speeds up development)
4-Like any programming, there is a big difference between doing it and doing it well. Writing good unit tests is an art form. This aspect of TDD is often not discussed, many managers tend to focus on metrics like code coverage; those metrics tell you nothing about the quality of the unit tests.

## Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes

| ES6 class constructors                                                                                        | ES5 function constructors                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| As discussed above ES6 class constructors creates objects by adding function to their prototypes (Blueprint)  | ES5 function constructors also create objects along with inheritance property.                                                |
| It ensures that this keyword used by the developer is referring to the object being created by the developer. | Any function can be used as a function constructor and it primarily focuses on the creation of reusable object creation code. |
|                                                                                                               |

## Why REST?

The rest parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array, providing a way to represent variadic functions in JavaScript.

**A function definition's last parameter can be prefixed with "..." (three U+002E FULL STOP characters), which will cause all remaining (user supplied) parameters to be placed within a standard JavaScript array. Only the last parameter in a function definition can be a rest parameter.**

**functional programming:**
Functional programming (also called FP) is a way of thinking about software construction by creating pure functions, and i think it realated to methmatical thiking for how implement function

**object-oriented programming (OOP):**
programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, like creating objects and classas

**class:**
a template for creating objects, make Sub classing with extends

**super:**
keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.

**this:**
this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.

**Test Driven Development (TDD):**
software development practice that focuses on creating unit test cases

**Jest:**
Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

**Continuous Integration (CI):**
Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day.

REST:
REpresentational State Transfer

Data Model:
A data model refers to the logical inter-relationships and data flow between different data elements involved in the information world. It also documents the way data is stored and retrieved. ... Data models help represent what data is required and what format is to be used for different business processes
