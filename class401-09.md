## When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?

**Basic Authorization** Use to access API directly with username and password
**Bearer Authorization** is more secure and requires two calls, one to get a token and one to get the data - bearer is preferred because of the extra security

## What does the JSON Web Token package do?

allows you to use JSON Web Tokens to securely transfer data between two parties as JSON objects

## What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?

a secret should be secure,secrets should be encrypted,secret should be visually different from id

## What is RBAC?

RBAC is nothing more than the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. The system needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs. Access is then assigned to each person based strictly on their role assignment. With tight adherence to access requirements established for each role, access management becomes much easier.

## Benefits of RBAC?

With the proper implementation of RBAC, the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.

RBAC may sound intimidating, but it can in reality be easy to implement, and will make the ongoing management of access rights much easier and more secure.

The data breach you prevent may be your own.
