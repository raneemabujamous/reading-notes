### When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?

function

### What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?

Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult. If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.

### How can you best test context?

The best way to test Context is to make our tests unaware of its existence and avoiding mocks. We want to test our components in the same way that developers would use them (behavioral testing) and mimic the way they would run in our applications (integration testing).

### context

React's context allows you to share information to any component, by storing it in a central place and allowing access to any component that requests it (usually you are only able to pass data from parent to child via props)

### “useContext”

“useContext” hook is used to create common data that can be accessed throughout the component hierarchy without passing the props down manually to each level. Context defined will be available to all the child components without involving “props”.

### static context

This rule applies when the static contextType property of a React component is not properly specified. The contextType property is used to consume a context created with React. ... When the property is specified for a React component, you can access the current value of the context using this.
