### Why is access control important?

it is a valuable security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use any given resource

### Describe an application that would need access control.

An education used by instructors and students to submit assignments and keep track of grades such as canvas. As a student, I want to be able to see my grades and assignments, but as an instructor you should be able to see everyones grades and create assignments.

### What is a role used for?

A role is a collection of privileges that can be granted to one or more users or other roles. Roles help you grant and manage sets of privileges for various categories of users, rather than grant those privileges to each user individually. For example, several users might require administrative privileges.

### Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

Role based access control is easily scalable because you can globally set access rules for different types of users based on their role.
1.Roles can be added easily.
2.Role actions can modified easily and will updates for all users.
3.Routes actions can be changed easily.

### Authorization

### Role Based Access Control

role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control

### Capabilities

The actions that a user has been granted permission to use, such as crud operations , It refers to a value that references an object along with an associated set of access rights. A user program on a capability-based operating system must use a capability to access an object. The object-capability model is a computer security model. A capability describes a transferable right to perform one operations on a given object. It can be obtained by the following combination: An unforgeable reference that can be sent in messages. A message that specifies the operation to be performed.

dealing more with event

## What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

how can pass event and listen for it

#### Event Driven Programming

Node. js uses event driven programming. It means as soon as Node starts its server, it simply initiates its variables, declares functions and then simply waits for event to occur. It is the one of the reason why Node.

##### All objects that emit events are instances of the EventEmitter class. These objects expose an eventEmitter.on() function that allows one or more functions to be attached to named events emitted by the object. Typically, event names are camel-cased strings but any valid JavaScript property key can be used.
