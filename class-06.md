### Object Definition
You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:
Example
` const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};`
#### Object Properties
The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:

| Property | Value |
| --- | ----------- |
| firstName | John |
| age | 50 |

## The HTML DOM (Document Object Model)
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

### With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

* JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
* JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
* JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
* JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
* JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page
### What You Will Learn

* How to change the content of HTML elements
* How to change the style (CSS) of HTML elements
* How to react to HTML DOM events
* How to add and delete HTML elements
## What is the DOM?
The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:

"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

* Core DOM - standard model for all document types
* XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
* HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents
