## Adding Events
** React events are written in camelCase syntax: `onClick` instead of `onclick.` React event handlers are written inside curly braces:`onClick={shoot}`  instead of `onClick="shoot()".` **



## ReactJS Component’s Lifecycle
** In React, every component created is goes through process that involves various lifecycle methods is termed as component’s lifecycle. The lifecycle methods are invoked at different phases of the lifecycle of a component.**

## Mounting

Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

* constructor()
* getDerivedStateFromProps()
* render()
* componentDidMount()
The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.



## React State


React components has a built-in state object.

The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.

When the state object changes, the component re-renders.


** Changing the state Object **
To change a value in the state object, use the this.setState() method.

When a value in the state object changes, the component will re-render, meaning that the output will change according to the new value(s).
