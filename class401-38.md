### How granular should your reducers be?

The reducer takes two parameters: state and action . You need to have an initial value so that when Redux calls the reducer for the first time with undefined , it will return the initialState . Then the function uses a switch statement to determine which type of action it's dealing with.

### Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched

Whether this is good or bad depends on your app. having many stores (or Redux reducers) handling the same action is actually very convenient because it divides responsibilities, and also lets people work on feature branches without colliding with the rest of the team. In my experience it's easier to maintain unrelated mutations separately than one giant mutation. But there are cases where this doesn't work too well. I'd say they are often symptoms of a suboptimal state model. For example, in some cases, one reducer may depend on data from another(like moving a message from unread to message, or even promote a message as a new thread from message to thread) is a symptom of a problem. If you have to move stuff inside your state a lot, maybe the state shape needs to be more normalized.

### Name a strategy for preventing the above

thunk

### store

A store is an immutable object tree in Redux. A store is a state container which holds the application's state. Redux can have only a single store in your application. Whenever a store is created in Redux, you need to specify the reducer. Let us see how we can create a store using the createStore method from Redux.

### combined reducers

The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore . The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object.

## Redux’s

## By default, Redux’s actions are dispatched synchronously, which is a problem for any non-trivial app that needs to communicate with an external API or perform side effects. Redux also allows for middleware that sits between an action being dispatched and the action reaching the reducers.

There are two very popular middleware libraries that allow for side effects and asynchronous actions: Redux Thunk and Redux Saga. In this post, you will explore Redux Thunk.

Thunk is a programming concept where a function is used to delay the evaluation/calculation of an operation.

### Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object. That function receives the store’s dispatch method, which is then used to dispatch regular synchronous actions inside the function’s body once the asynchronous operations have been completed.
