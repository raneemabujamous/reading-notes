### Describe “The Cloud”

The cloud refers to software and services that run on the Internet, instead of locally on your computer. Most cloud services can be accessed through a Web browser like Firefox or Google Chrome, and some companies offer dedicated mobile apps.

### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

Containers are a form of operating system virtualization. A single container might be used to run anything from a small microservice or software process to a larger application. Inside a container are all the necessary executables, binary code, libraries, and configuration files.

### What is auto-scaling?

AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. ... AWS Auto Scaling makes scaling simple with recommendations that allow you to optimize performance, costs, or balance between them.

### What is bandwidth?

The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it's actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?

calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor.

### Server Instances

A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based.
In very simple words, a server running our application is called an instance. Think of one server as one instance. An Instance is a virtual machine which runs our workloads in the cloud. ... One single instance can host our workload or it can be hosted by quite a number of them grouped together in a cluster

### Containers

A self contained environment that contains an application and all of its dependencies.

### Cloud Services

Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users

### Cloud Architecture

All of the cloud services used in a project such as databases and computing resources.

### AWS

Cloud Services - Amazon Web Services (AWS)

### EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku

Heroku is generally simpler to get up and running as AWS has a fairly steep initial learning curve

### What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

The Lambda functions can perform any kind of computing task, from serving web pages and processing streams of data to calling APIs and integrating with other AWS services.

The concept of “serverless” computing refers to not needing to maintain your own servers to run these functions. AWS Lambda is a fully managed service that takes care of all the infrastructure for you. And so “serverless” doesn’t mean that there are no servers involved: it just means that the servers, the operating systems, the network layer and the rest of the infrastructure have already been taken care of, so that you can focus on writing application code.

### How does AWS Lambda work?

Each Lambda function runs in its own container. When a function is created, Lambda packages it into a new container and then executes that container on a multi-tenant cluster of machines managed by AWS. Before the functions start running, each function’s container is allocated its necessary RAM and CPU capacity. Once the functions finish running, the RAM allocated at the beginning is multiplied by the amount of time the function spent running. The customers then get charged based on the allocated memory and the amount of run time the function took to complete.

The entire infrastructure layer of AWS Lambda is managed by AWS. Customers don’t get much visibility into how the system operates, but they also don’t need to worry about updating the underlying machines, avoiding network contention, and so on—AWS takes care of this itself.

And since the service is fully managed, using AWS Lambda can save you time on operational tasks. When there is no infrastructure to maintain, you can spend more time working on the application code—even though this also means you give up the flexibility of operating your own infrastructure.

One of the distinctive architectural properties of AWS Lambda is that many instances of the same function, or of different functions from the same AWS account, can be executed concurrently. Moreover, the concurrency can vary according to the time of day or the day of the week, and such variation makes no difference to Lambda—you only get charged for the compute your functions use. This makes AWS Lambda a good fit for deploying highly scalable cloud computing solutions.
