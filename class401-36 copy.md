### What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”

It's pure JavaScript and it's convenient. If you don't have a back-end and you're relying on a third-party API, you can't always ask them to set a specific cookie for your site.
Local Storage is available for every page and remains even when the web browser is closed, but you cannot read it on the server. The stored data has no expiration date in local storage. ... Local Storage is for client side, whereas cookies are for the client as well as server side.

### Explain 3rd party cookies.

Third-party cookies are created by domains that are not the website (or domain) that you are visiting.

### Redux

Redux is a tiny library, but its contracts and APIs are carefully chosen to spawn an ecosystem of tools and extensions, and the community has created a wide variety of helpful addons, libraries, and tools. You don't need to use any of these addons to use Redux, but they can help make it easier to implement features and solve problems in your application.

For an extensive catalog of libraries, addons, and tools related to Redux, check out the Redux Ecosystem Links list. Also, the React/Redux Links list contains tutorials and other useful resources for anyone learning React or Redux.

This page lists some of the Redux-related addons that the Redux maintainers have vetted personally, or that have shown widespread adoption in the community. Don't let this discourage you from trying the rest of them! The ecosystem is growing too fast, and we have a limited time to look at everything. Consider these the “staff picks”, and don't hesitate to submit a PR if you've built something wonderful with Redux.
