## Compare and contrast REST and SOAP web services?

The difference is: SOAP is a XML-based message protocol, while REST is an architectural style. SOAP uses WSDL for communication between consumer and provider, whereas REST just uses XML or JSON to send and receive data. SOAP invokes services by calling RPC method, REST just simply calls services via URL path.٢١‏/٠٣‏/
