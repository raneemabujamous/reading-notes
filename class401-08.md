## What is JSON Web Token?

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

## When should you use JSON Web Tokens?

Here are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:

### Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.

### Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.

### What is the JSON Web Token structure?

In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

**Header**<br>
**Payload**<br>
**Signature**<br>
Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following.

`xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz`

## Write the following steps in the correct order

1.Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
2.Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
3.Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
4.Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
5.Make a request to the access token endpoint
6.Receive access token
7.Receive authorization code

## What can you do with an authorization code?

An authorization code allows you to send information, such as a request for an access token, to a secure resource.

## What can you do with an access token?

Access tokens are used to make API requests on behalf of a user

## What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

OAuth contains authorization requests, access tokens and refresh tokens and widely accepted as the standard for modern web applications. It is well documented and easy to implement.

### Client ID:

unique identifier , is a public identifier for apps. Even though it’s public, it’s best that it isn’t guessable by third parties, so many implementations use something like a 32-character hex string.

### Client Secret:

Used to authenticate client and is only known by the server and client
Authentication Endpoint:
used to request access tokens or authorization

### Access Token Endpoint:

used to get an access token or refresh token and its A token endpoint is an HTTP endpoint that micropub clients can use to obtain an access token given an authorization code.

### API Endpoint:

the connection used to communicate with an API meaning is one end of a communication channel. When an API interacts with another system, the touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints. For APIs, an endpoint can include a URL of a server or service.

### Authorization Code:

allows you to send information, such as a request for an access token, to a secure resource ,and is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space.

### Access Token:

used for token-based authentication , are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user’s data.
