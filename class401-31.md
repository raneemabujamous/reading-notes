### Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()

useReducer() is a method from the React Hooks API, similar to useState but gives you more control to manage the state. It takes a reducer function and initial state as arguments and returns the state and dispatch method:

### Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

In other words, it's just like a normal function. Its name should always start with use so that you can tell at a glance that the rules of Hooks apply to it.

### What do custom hooks usually do?

Custom hooks allow us to have cleaner functional components, remove logic from the UI layer, and prevent code duplication by bringing common use cases to reusable hooks.

### Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications

1. useClippy
   A hook for copying data to the clipboard and retrieving/pasting it using Ctrl-C/Command-C and Ctrl-V/Command-V.
2. useBrowserContextCommunication
   useBrowserContextCommunication uses the Broadcast Channel API to deliver an easy solution for communication between different browser contexts (tabs, iframes, windows)

   3. useScript

useScript is a hook for loading (and notifying when theyâ€™re loaded) external scripts, dynamically.

### Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work

Now we need to fetch the data from the API with the useEffect hook. import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; function App() { const [data, setData] = useState([]); useEffect(() => { // here goes the data fetching }); return ( <ul> {data. map(item => ( <li key={item.id}> <a href={item. url}>{item}

### reducer

The concept of a Reducer became popular in JavaScript with the rise of Redux as state management solution for React. ... Basically reducers are there to manage state in an application. For instance, if a user writes someth
ing in an HTML input field, the application has to manage this UI state (e.g. controlled components).

### Context

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

### Before You Use Context

Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.

If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.
