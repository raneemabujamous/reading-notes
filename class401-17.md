### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information (or resources) to be generated by a server. ... Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.
A request-response cycle (sometimes called a transaction) has three phases, the first for transferring user-entered data to the objects associated with the request page, the second for invoking an action method, and the third for generating and returning the response.

### Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

All resources are hosted on a server. The server’s location on the web can be identified by its IP address, however, IP addresses aren’t particularly user friendly, and instead we use URLS (such as http://www.google.co.uk) to search for a resource.
Once the client’s request has reached the server, the server will search for and return the information the client is requesting. Often times, this means querying a database, loading the information into an html page, and returning the HTML text to the user in the body of the HTTP response.

### What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

It is: “Making an application available to end users”. This means that the end user has opened his/her browser, types “www.app.com” and sees the application in production, hence the www.app.com URL, fully functional

### server

A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

### Pub/Sub

which stands for Publisher/Subscriber, allows services to communicate asynchronously, with latencies on the order of 100 milliseconds.

Pub/Sub is used for streaming analytics and data integration pipelines to ingest and distribute data. It is equally effective as messaging-oriented middleware for service integration or as a queue to parallelize tasks.

### WRRC

A cycle of requests and responses that allow the internet to exist. Clients send requests to servers and servers send responses.

### Amazon EC2 presents a true virtual computing environment, allowing you to use web service interfaces to launch instances with a variety of operating systems, load them with your custom application environment, manage your network’s access permissions, and run your image using as many or few systems as you desire.

### You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, . NET, PHP, Node. js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.
