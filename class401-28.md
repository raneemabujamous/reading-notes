### Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

react apps are single page app ,A React app consists of a single HTML file index.html. The views are coded in JSX format as components.
create-react-app provides a great starting point to start a new react app fully configured with webpack, live reloading, etc. But, sadly, it doesn't provide a way to provide different index files with a different set of entry points.

### What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested

it goes to the new componetnt and remove the old one _cleans up _

### What does props.children contain?

props. children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component. This component contains an <img> that is receiving some props and then it is displaying {props. children} .

### How do useState() and this.setState() differ?

The setState function is used to handle the state object in a React class component.
setState is merging the previous state with the new one, it means that you dont have to pass the full state object every time you want to change some part of the state. React will update given properties and won't touch the rest. The useState's updater rewrites a previous state with a new one and it does not perform any merging. Its just replacement instead of merging.

### The useState hook

is a special function that takes the initial state as an argument and returns an array of two entries. Syntax: The first element is the initial state and the second one is a function that is used for updating the state. ... And the value returned by the function will be used as the initial state

### Mounting and Un-Mounting

The componentWillUnmount() method allows us to execute the React code when the component gets destroyed or unmounted from the DOM (Document Object Model). This method is called during the Unmounting phase of the React Life-cycle i.e before the component gets unmounted.
The main job of React is to figure out how to modify the DOM to match what the components want to be rendered on the screen. React does so by "mounting" (adding nodes to the DOM), "unmounting" (removing them from the DOM), and "updating" (making changes to nodes already in the DOM)

### Effects Without Cleanup

Sometimes, we want to run some additional code after React has updated the DOM. Network requests, manual DOM mutations, and logging are common examples of effects that don’t require a cleanup. We say that because we can run them and immediately forget about them. Let’s compare how classes and Hooks let us express such side effects.

Example Using Classes
In React class components, the render method itself shouldn’t cause side effects. It would be too early — we typically want to perform our effects after React has updated the DOM.

This is why in React classes, we put side effects into componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. Coming back to our example, here is a React counter class component that updates the document title right after React makes changes to the DOM:
