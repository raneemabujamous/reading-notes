### Why is the Context API useful?

Context is a good way to share values between our components without using props every time, but these criteria should not be only one. If some values are needed on different levels of the components tree and for many elements, it will be a good idea to use context for this data.

### Can a component outside of a provider get its context?

when using global context
we can use the useContext hook. We create the UserContext by calling the React. createContext method with a default context value. Then in the Users component, we call the useContext hook with UserContext to accxess the current value of UserContext

### What are some common use cases for using the Context API?

The Context API can be used to share data with multiple components, without having to pass data through props manually. For example, some use cases the Context API is ideal for: theming, user language, authentication
Theming — Pass down app theme.
i18n — Pass down translation messages.
Authentication — Pass down current authenticated user.

### Describe “Context Hell”

One way to get rid of additional contexts is by adding more variables to the value that is provided by a context.

### global state

To put it simply, global state is the data that is shared between all the components within a React application. When the state is changed, or let's say a filter is added, the components re-render accordingly.

### global context

This global context is about how concerned we are worldwide, how we make decisions about global issues and how we can act in a responsible way to make the world a better place. ... The opportunities and tensions provided by world- interconnectedness; The impact of decision- making on humankind and the environment.

### provider

The <Provider> component makes the Redux store available to any nested components that need to access the Redux store. Since any React component in a React Redux app can be connected to the store, most applications will render a <Provider> at the top level, with the entire app's component tree inside of it.

### consumer

A consumer is any person or group who is the final user of a product or service. Here are some examples: A person who pays a hairdresser to cut and style their hair. A company that buys a printer for company use.

### DEFINITION OF ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC)

Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

Employees are only allowed to access the information necessary to effectively perform their job duties. Access can be based on several factors, such as authority, responsibility, and job competency. In addition, access to computer resources can be limited to specific tasks such as the ability to view, create, or modify a file.

As a result, lower-level employees usually do not have access to sensitive data if they do not need it to fulfill their responsibilities. This is especially helpful if you have many employees and use third-parties and contractors that make it difficult to closely monitor network access. Using RBAC will help in securing your company’s sensitive data and important applications.
