## Middleware

**functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.**
1-As name suggests it comes in middle of something and that is request and response cycle
2-Middleware has access to request and response object
3-Middleware has access to next function of request-response life cycle

**Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware**

- Auth middleware

- Logging Middleware
- custom ASP.NET Core middleware

**The route handler is middleware?** fulse

They are not middleware functions by definition

**In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?**
res.send()
res.redirect()
res.render()
res.sendFile()
res.download()

**At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?**

If one of the middleware has instructed the request object to redirect, the view that is ready to execute, will not execute.
For example, if the user is planned on going to the dashboard view, but middleware has told the request to redirect to the login page instead then the dashboard view, and therefore the controller, will not execute at all. It will be skipped over. Masonite checks if the request is redirecting before executing a view.
This will inject the Request class into the constructor when that middleware is executed. Read more about how middleware works in the Middleware documentation.
This provider loads the ability to use sessions, adds a session helper to all views and even attaches a session attribute to the request class

**What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response**
means that you're already in the Body or Finished state, but some function tried to set a header, like callbacks invoked twice for example.
