## What is a Stack

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

### Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed

### Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.

### Top - This is the top of the stack.

### Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.

### IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

### FILO First In Last Out

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

### LIFO Last In First Out

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

### Push O(1)

Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

1-Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
2-Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
3-Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
4-Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
5-Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
5-IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

### FIFO

First In First Out

This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

### LILO

Last In Last Out

This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
