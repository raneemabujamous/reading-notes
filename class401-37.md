### Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?

So Redux works around the idea of having a central state called a store. To change the state, a component has to dispatch an action. The action is then passed on to the reducer, which changes the state of our application

### What is the purpose of a reducer?

Basically reducers are there to manage state in an application. For instance, if a user writes something in an HTML input field, the application has to manage this UI state (e.g. controlled components)

### What does an action contain?

A JavaScript action is a reusable action based on JavaScript that runs in the client just like the nanoflow, and can use capabilities such as HTML5 browser functions, Cordova plugins, and React Native modules. JavaScript actions are similar to Java actions, but run on the client instead of the server.

### Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?

If the new state is different, the reducer must create new object, and making a copy is a way to describe the unchanged part.

### immutable state

Immutable state means its value cannot be changed once it's created. ... A mutable state allows us to modify already created data structures and change them whichever way we want.

### time travel in redux

Time travel is the ability to move back and forth among the previous states of an application and view the results in real time. With Redux, given a specific state and a specific action, the next state of the application is always exactly the same.

### action creator

An action creator is a function that literally creates an action object. In Redux, action creators simply return an action object and pass the argument value if necessary.

### reducer

Reducers are pure functions in that they produce the same output for a given input. They are without side effects and handle each state transition synchronously. Each reducer function takes the latest Action dispatched, the current state, and determines whether to return a newly modified state or the original state.

### dispatch

dispatch() is the method used to dispatch actions and trigger state changes to the store. react-redux is simply trying to give you convenient access to it. Note, however, that dispatch is not available on props if you do pass in actions to your connect function.

### Using combineReducers

#### Core Conceptsâ€‹

The most common state shape for a Redux app is a plain Javascript object containing "slices" of domain-specific data at each top-level key. Similarly, the most common approach to writing reducer logic for that state shape is to have "slice reducer" functions, each with the same (state, action) signature, and each responsible for managing all updates to that specific slice of state. Multiple slice reducers can respond to the same action, independently update their own slice as needed, and the updated slices are combined into the new state object.

Because this pattern is so common, Redux provides the combineReducers utility to implement that behavior. It is an example of a higher-order reducer, which takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and returns a new reducer function.
