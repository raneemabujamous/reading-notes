## Rendering Multiple Components
You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.

## Keys
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:
 Extracting Components with Keys
Keys only make sense in the context of the surrounding array.
For example, if you extract a ListItem component, you should keep the key on the <ListItem /> elements in the array rather than on the <li> element in the ListItem itself. 

 ## JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
* Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic between variables and/or values.
* JavaScript Assignment Operators
* Assignment operators are used to assign values to JavaScript variables.
JavaScript String Operators
The + operator, and the += operator can also be used to concatenate (add) strings.

Given that text1 = "Good ", text2 = "Morning", and text3 = "",

* Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

* Conditional (Ternary) Operator
The conditional operator assigns a value to a variable based on a condition.

* Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
* JavaScript Bitwise Operators
Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers. Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.
* The typeof Operator
The typeof operator returns the type of a variable, object, function or expression:

* The delete Operator
The delete operator deletes a property from an object:
* The in Operator
The in operator returns true if the specified property is in the specified object, otherwise false:
* The instanceof Operator
The instanceof operator returns true if the specified object is an instance of the specified object:
* The void Operator
The void operator evaluates an expression and returns undefined. This operator is often used to obtain the undefined primitive value, using "void(0)" (useful when evaluating an expression without using the return value).
