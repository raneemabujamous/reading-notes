### Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

The Redux Toolkit generates the new state from the direct changes to the old state. ... The reducers that are written with immer are 2 to 3 times slower than a normal Redux reducer. Here is an example of a Reducer function that uses the state as immutable and one which makes changes directly to the state.

## What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience.

## redux toolkit slices

What is createSlice in Redux Toolkit? createSlice is a higher order function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions and a slice name. It automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.

Prominent examples for namespaces include file systems, which assign names to files.
