### What are serverless functions?

A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier.

### If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

You could use serverless functions

### Describe how a CDN works

A CDN is a network of servers that distributes content from an “origin” server throughout the world by caching content close to where each end user is accessing the internet via a web-enabled device. The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed.

### Cloud storage

Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage as a service. ... This gives you agility, global scale and durability, with “anytime, anywhere” data access.

### CDN

A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

### What is Amazon API Gateway?

Recently, AWS also launched AWS HTTP APIs. These are a potential alternative to API Gateway REST APIs that we discuss in detail in our Ultimate Guide to AWS HTTP APIs.

Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

Many Serverless applications use Amazon API Gateway, which conveniently replaces the API servers with a managed serverless solution.

How does API Gateway work?
API Gateway sits between the backend services of your API and your API’s users, handling the HTTP requests to your API endpoints and routing them to the correct backends. It provides a set of tools that help you manage your API definitions and the mappings between endpoints and their respective backend services. It can also generate API references from your definitions and make them available to your users as API documentation.

API Gateway integrates with many other AWS services like AWS Lambda, AWS SNS, AWS IAM, and Cognito Identity Pools. These integrations allow for fully managed authentication and authorization layers, as well as detailed metrics and tracing for API requests.
