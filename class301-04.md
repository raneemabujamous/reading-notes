## React Forms
#### Handling Forms
Handling forms is about how you handle the data when it changes value or gets submitted.In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM.In React, form data is usually handled by the components.When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state.
You can control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange attribute:

** Note: You must initialize the state in the constructor method before you can use it.

** Note: You get access to the field value by using the event.target.value syntax.

** Add an event handler in the onChange attribute, and let the event handler update the state object:

### Submitting Forms
** You can control the submit action by adding an event handler in the onSubmit attribute:

** Note that we use event.preventDefault() to prevent the form from actually being submitted.


## Multiple Input Fields
You can control the values of more than one input field by adding a name attribute to each element.

When you initialize the state in the constructor, use the field names.

To access the fields in the event handler use the event.target.name and event.target.value syntax.

** To update the state in the this.setState method, use square brackets [bracket notation] around the property name.
